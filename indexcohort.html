           <h1 class="cohort_question"> what is the geekwise academy cohort program?</h1>
           <p class="paragraph">The Geekwise Academy Cohort program has been developed to bridge the gap between Geekwise Academy course students and their ability to move into roles as developers in the local technology industry. </p>
            <p class="paragragh">The Cohort consists of two phases. The first is a two week internship for the 20 individuals that were invited to the Cohort program. This phase includes QA and testing of the invitees skill set. In phase two, 8 of the 20 Invitees will be chosen to participate in a 24 week internship program. Phase two consists of three assignments each eight weeks in length. During this time the Cohorts will complete work for clients through projects of increased difficulty. Also, Cohort participants will be required to co-teach Geekwise Academy classes. They will work with the Cohort Director and Bethany Mily to prepare for this opportunity.</p>

I feel at home at Bitwise and I’m excited to build a career in a field that will continue to change throughout my lifetime.</p>

I am very honored and humbled to have been chosen and really consider this a massive building block that will guide me through the rest of my development career. I'm also really excited that I don't have to sell cell phones ever again!</p>

I’ve always had a deep appreciation for technology and more specifically, the ability to create with the power of a computer. Being chosen for the Cohort is a blessing that I hope will give me the tools needed to build something that will help make peoples lives better.</p>

                  <p class="story">When I was invited to be in Cohort, I was overwhelmed with emotions. I was happy, but I was especially grateful for the opportunity because I have never had a community believe in me the way Bitwise has. I'm excited to see what I can accomplish by the end of the program and cannot wait to see what it helps me accomplish in the future.</p>

                  <p class="story">When I joined the Cohort I was hoping to gain the knowledge and ability to become a top developer. I see it as a chance to challenge myself to learn new skills, better serve my community, and support my family. I look forward to all the opportunities that are ahead, but with great power comes great responsibility. I am ready for that responsibility.</p>
